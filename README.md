# NortonDomeExplorer
Classical Newtonian mechanics is generally considered a prime example of 
determinism. It is however possible to construct systems within the 
confines of Newtonian mechanics which appear indeterministic.
The NortonDomeExplorer was developed for the exploration of such an 
example:[\[1\]](#ref_DS1) the dynamics of a point-mass on Malament-mounds[\[2\]](#ref_mal),
more specifically the case of the Norton Dome[\[3\]](#ref_nort).

## Background: Norton Domes and Malament-mounds
In 2003, the philosopher of science John D. Norton presented a thought experiment which
exhibits non-deterministic behaviour within the context of Newtonian mechanics. The setup 
is quite simple. Imagine a hill (or mound) with a shape such that a point mass located 
on the apex (where it has a zero velocity) may roll downward following the hill's curvature 
exactly due to the downward gravitational pull. The shape of the hill is given by the 
equation:

This appears as an innocent example of an
unstable equilibrium situation
